These disruptive technologies often disrupt workforce participation by allowing technologically unsophisticated individuals to enter and become competitive in the industrial workforce. Disruptive technologies offer a revolutionary change in the conduct of processes or operations.</b><h3>
			<h3 style = "color:red"><b>Take computers as an example. In the 1950s, computers were multi-million dollar machines that had to be housed in large buildings and that could only be operated by people with advanced training in computer science. Today, computers with orders of magnitude more power and immensely greater functionality than the 1950s-era machines are being carried around in the pockets of almost every adult and teenager in the world. Disruptive technology was the economic force that brought computing power to the masses.<br/><br/>
			In industry after industry, disruptive technologies deliver more for less and change everything from how we communicate with one another to how we work and shop.</b><h3>
