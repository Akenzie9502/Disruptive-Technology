		<h3 ><b>When Western Union declined to purchase Alexander Graham Bell's telephone patents for $100,000, their highest-profit market was long-distance telegraphy. Telephones were only useful at that time for very local calls. Short-distance telegraphy barely existed as a market segment, which explains Western Union's decision to not enter the emerging telephone market. However, telephones quickly displaced telegraphs, as telephones offered much greater communication capacity than telegraphs. A few years later and now social media is one of the biggest disruptors to the way we communicate with others. <br/><br/>
		
		Along with social media, we see other methods of communication changing tremendously. Take the Uber Network as an example, this allows consumers with smartphones to submit a trip request, which the software program then automatically sends to the Uber driver nearest to the consumer, alerting the driver to the location of the customer.....<i>how cool is that?</i></h3></b>
