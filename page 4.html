		<h3><b>Technology in the clinic has been shown to help doctors spend more time with each patient. With telemedicine, smart algorithms and health trackers making it possible to stream medical data from every home, patients wouldn’t have to wait weeks for a doctor’s appointment or have to diagnose themselves, but would get the help they need near instantly. Studies have shown that medical outcomes increase and costs go down when technology like artificial intelligence is combined with the human touch of physicians.</b></h3>

		<h3><b>One  of  the  <i>most</i>  promising  disruptive  information  technologies,  the  <u>Personal  Health  Record</u> (PHR), has advanced efforts to put electronic medical records in place throughout the health care system.  Omid Moghadam, director of PHR programs at Intel, describes a PHR as a record “owned and controlled by the patient that incorporates  data  the  patient  enters,  but  also  includes authenticated information. . . . from all of the places the patient is involved with—insurance company, hospital, doctors’  offices,  labs,  and  so  forth” </b></h3>
