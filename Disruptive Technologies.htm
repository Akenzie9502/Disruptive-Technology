 create growth in the industries they penetrate or create entirely new 
industries through the introduction of products and services that are 
dramatically cheaper, better, and more convenient. These disruptive 
technologies often disrupt workforce participation by allowing 
technologically unsophisticated individuals to enter and become 
competitive in the industrial workforce. Disruptive technologies offer a
 revolutionary change in the conduct of processes or operations.</b></h3><h3>
			</h3><h3 style="color:red"><b>Take computers as an example. In the 
1950s, computers were multi-million dollar machines that had to be 
housed in large buildings and that could only be operated by people with
 advanced training in computer science. Today, computers with orders of 
magnitude more power and immensely greater functionality than the 
1950s-era machines are being carried around in the pockets of almost 
every adult and teenager in the world. Disruptive technology was the 
economic force that brought computing power to the masses.<br><br>
			In industry after industry, disruptive technologies deliver more for 
less and change everything from how we communicate with one another to 
how we work and shop.</b></h3><h3>
